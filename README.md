# Re:Display

A custom crafted Display Manager

---

This is a display manager I am coding to use for myself. It is being designed for Arch Linux with Hyprland, and for the moment is only being tested on that.


Work to do:

1. ~~switch to tty2~~
2. print keyboard input
3. systemd service file improvements
4. login system
5. ~~display sessions~~
6. choose session
7. ncurses gui
8. config file
9. terminal args
10. hyprland specific launch/logout
0. come up with name
