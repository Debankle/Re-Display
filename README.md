# Re:Display

A custom crafted Display Manager

---

This is a display manager I am coding to use for myself. It is being designed for Arch Linux with Hyprland, and for the moment is only being tested on that.

Heavily inspired by ly, and taking concepts from other display managers. ly was being problematic with my hyprland sessions, so I decided to try and solve this (it's not going to work).


Work to do:

1. ~~switch to tty2~~
2. print keyboard input
3. systemd service file improvements
4. login system
5. ~~display sessions~~
6. choose session
7. ncurses gui
8. config file
9. terminal args
10. hyprland specific launch/logout
0. come up with name
